# Who am I?

As an engineer, I hail from the annals of history when the internet was dial-up and the modem actually made sounds. Before any of you call me a boomer, please remember, that my callouses tell the tales of broken commits and rebased branches long before Git was cool (someone bring up SVN, please). And I will allow everyone to judge me once they see what my wallpaper looked like in 2011.

I grew up in New Delhi, India but am a bengali (cue the communist jokes now). I have lived all over India, from Bihar to Karnataka and Gujarat to West Bengal and have explored quiet a few number of places. But nowadays, I call Glasgow my home. So here's a picture of me doing one of the things I enjoy -

# Bunch of things I enjoy

- I really like tinkering with electronics and changing stuff to how I wish them to work.
- Would enjoy a cup of tea and a great movie. 🎥
- Definitely can talk about tech for hours (don't know who wants to hear it though).
- Find me driving or karting if I need to lose some steam.
- Get me food and we're golden.

# What I'm looking for

To be honest, I want to be stimulated academically and want to solve problems. It's the whole reason I chose to go into engineering. People often ask me how I manage to change fields so many times. I just tend to point out, that at the core of all those experiences is an innate curiosity of mine to solve the problem at hand. Whether it be upper-limb prosthetics, writing articles for a local magazine, designing VLSI chips or more recently working on Quantum Photonics. They have all inculcated some or the other skill in me and I have learnt something new from each experience. THAT is invaluable.

To sum it up... I'M LOOKING FOR CHALLENGES.
